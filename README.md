# Music Genre Classification Project

![Project Logo](link_to_your_logo_or_image.png)

Welcome to the Music Genre Classification Project! This repository contains code and resources for my final year project, where I explore and compare various machine learning methods for the classification of music genres. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques, I aim to accurately categorize songs into different genres based on their audio features.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective:** Investigate and compare machine learning algorithms for music genre classification.
- **Datasets:** Utilize diverse music datasets to ensure robustness and variety in classification.
- **Methods:** Experiment with deep learning, ensemble methods, and traditional classifiers.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract and analyze audio features like spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and rhythm patterns.
- **Model Evaluation:** Thoroughly assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory provide step-by-step walkthroughs of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Results:** Document the findings, insights, and comparative analysis of different methods in the project report.
